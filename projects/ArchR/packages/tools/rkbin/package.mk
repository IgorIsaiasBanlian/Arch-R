  # RK3326: the stock TPL blob initialises every DDR type at 333MHz and
  # mainline has no px30 dmc driver, so the memory stays at 333MHz for
  # the life of the system. That is far below what the BSP-based OSes on
  # the same boards run: dArkOS scales the DDR with dmc_ondemand up to
  # the 786MHz BSP ceiling and pins 528MHz even in its powersave mode.
  # Rewrite the frequency fields inside the TPL with Rockchip's own
  # ddrbin_tool (the long-standing ArkOS "DDR fix") so the memory comes
  # up at speed from boot. Override with RK3326_DDR_FREQ=666 if a board
  # proves unstable at 786.
