  # RK3326: the stock TPL blob initialises every DDR type at 333MHz and
  # mainline has no px30 dmc driver, so the memory stays at 333MHz for
  # the life of the system. That is far below what the BSP-based OSes on
  # the same boards run: dArkOS scales the DDR with dmc_ondemand up to
  # the 786MHz BSP ceiling and pins 528MHz even in its powersave mode.
  # Rewrite the frequency fields inside the TPL with Rockchip's own
  # ddrbin_tool (the long-standing ArkOS "DDR fix") so the memory comes
  # up at speed from boot.
  #
  # 786MHz failed the hardware boot test (2026-07-02, Soysauce): the
  # screen lights and the SoC resets in a loop before U-Boot, i.e. the
  # TPL DDR training does not converge at that speed on these chips.
  # dArkOS only reaches 786 through the BSP dmc driver's runtime
  # retraining, which is gentler than a fixed cold init. 666MHz is the
  # conservative step (still 2x the old 333); drop to 528 (dArkOS's own
  # powersave floor) if a board still fails.
