PKG_NAME="archr"
# archr is a local meta package with no upstream, so it carried an empty
# PKG_VERSION. That made the install_pkg dir "archr-" and gen-pacman-repo
# synthesize the constant version "archr.", so the package version never
# changed and pacman never saw an update for it (the main system config
# package). Stamp it with the build DAY so changes to system.cfg, runemu,
# wifictl, governors etc. ship as real `pacman -Syu` updates.
#
# Day resolution on purpose: the build system re-evaluates package.mk on
# every step and derives PKG_INSTALL from PKG_NAME-PKG_VERSION, so a
# seconds-resolution stamp gave the build and install steps different
# versions; the install silently skipped a PKG_INSTALL dir that did not
# exist and the image assembly then failed in post_install.
